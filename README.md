## Project Period

4th Semester, Spring 2018

## ArduEasy Code
House setup:
```C
house
{
    Temp = PIN A 12 as input
    CurrentTime = PIN A 13 as input
    time SavedTime = 00:00
    
    room Kitchen
    {
        Lamp1 = PIN 1 as output
        Lamp2 = PIN 2 as output
        CoffeeMachine = PIN 3 as output
        Button = PIN 4 as input
        Window = PIN 5 as output
        Lamps = {Lamp1, Lamp2}
    }
        room Bedroom
    {
        Blinds1 = PIN 6 as output
        Blinds2 = PIN 7 as output
        Blinds3 = PIN 8 as output
        Blinds = {Blinds1, Blinds2, Blinds3}
    }
}
```
Conditions:
```C
when (house.Kitchen.Button is true)
{
    float Fahrenheit = CelciusToFahrenheit(Temp)
    house.Kitchen.CoffeeMachine = true
    SavedTime = house.CurrentTime
    
    if (SavedTime + 00:15 is house.CurrentTime && Fahrenheit is above or equal 64)
    {
        int i = 0
        house.Kitchen.Window = true //Opens the window 15 mins after the coffee machine turned on if Fahrenheit >= 64.
    }
}
when (Time is 07:00)
{
    house.Bedroom.Blinds = true //This will open the blinds at 7.
    house.Kitchen.Lamps = true //Turns on the Lamps in the Kitchen
}
when (Time is 18:00)
{
    house.Bedroom.Blinds = false //This will close the blinds at 18.
}
function float CelciusToFahrenheit(int temp)
{
    float result = temp * 1.8 + 32
    return result
}
```
